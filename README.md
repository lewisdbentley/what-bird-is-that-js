## Intervaltraining-js

What it does:
- User hears two notes on the piano in succession
- The goal is to identify the musical interval between the two notes
- The user clicks the button of the interval they think it is
- The user has a running score
- There is feedback on which intervals the user succeeds most at, and which intervals they fail most at.
